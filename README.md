🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A machine learning–based Movie Recommendation System built with Python.
This project analyzes movie data and recommends movies to users based on similarity measures.

📌 Features

Content-based recommendation using similarity metrics (e.g., cosine similarity).

Recommends top N similar movies for a given input movie.

Interactive Jupyter Notebook implementation.

Uses pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and other Python libraries.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Language: Python 3

Libraries:

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

nltk / re (for text preprocessing, if used)

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

🚀 How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-recommendation-system.git
cd movie-recommendation-system


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Final-Movie-Recommendation_system.ipynb


Run all cells to train and test the recommendation system.

📊 Dataset

The system uses a movie metadata dataset (e.g., TMDB / IMDB dataset).

Dataset includes movie titles, genres, descriptions, etc.


🎯 Example Usage

Input: "The Dark Knight"

Output: Top 5 recommended movies such as "Batman Begins", "Inception", "The Prestige", etc.

✅ Future Improvements

Add collaborative filtering (user-based recommendations).

Build a web app interface with Flask/Streamlit.

Include hybrid recommendations (content + collaborative).
